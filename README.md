# PepCluster

**BLOSUM62-aware anchor-residue clustering for immunopeptides — with a fast Rust backend.**

PepCluster groups peptides by the similarity of their MHC-I **anchor residues**
(the first 3 + last 3 amino acids) using a BLOSUM62-normalized similarity metric
with double weight on the primary anchor positions P2 and PΩ. It is built for
large immunopeptidomics datasets: a Rust extension does the heavy lifting
(10–100× faster than pure Python), and a pure-Python fallback keeps it working
everywhere.

Unlike general-purpose sequence tools (e.g. MMseqs2), PepCluster distinguishes
anchor from non-anchor positions, which is what actually drives MHC-I binding
specificity — producing biologically interpretable clusters on short (8–14 aa)
peptides where full-length estimators break down.

## Install

```bash
pip install pepcluster
```

Prebuilt wheels are published for Linux, macOS, and Windows, so **no Rust
toolchain is required** for end users. If you install on a platform without a
wheel, pip builds from source (needs a Rust compiler — see
[Building from source](#building-from-source)).

---

## Quick start

### Command line

```bash
pepcluster -i examples/peptides.fasta -o out -t 0.6
```

This writes cluster assignments and per-cluster FASTA files under `out/`
(see [Output files](#output-files)).

### Python

```python
import pepcluster

# End-to-end: FASTA in → TSV + per-cluster FASTA out
stats = pepcluster.cluster_fasta("peptides.fasta", "out", threshold=0.6)
print(stats["n_clusters"], "clusters")

# Low-level: cluster a dict of unique 6-mer anchors → frequency
mapping, n_cmp, n_early = pepcluster.cluster_anchors(
    {"YLLAGV": 3, "YMLAGV": 1, "GYAWTK": 2}, 0.6)
# mapping: {anchor -> representative anchor}

# Optional Lloyd-style refinement on top of the greedy result
refined, refine_stats = pepcluster.refine_clusters(
    {"YLLAGV": 3, "YMLAGV": 1}, mapping, 0.6, iterations=3)
```

`pepcluster.HAS_RUST` tells you whether the compiled backend is active
(`cluster_anchors` / `refine_clusters` automatically use Rust when available and
fall back to identical pure-Python implementations otherwise).

## CLI options

| Flag | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `-i, --input` | *required* | Input FASTA file |
| `-o, --outdir` | `anchor_clusters` | Output directory |
| `-t, --threshold` | `0.6` | BLOSUM similarity threshold (0.0–1.0) |
| `--min-cluster-size` | `2` | Min members for a per-cluster FASTA |
| `--n-front` | `3` | N-terminal anchor length |
| `--n-back` | `3` | C-terminal anchor length |
| `--refinement` | off | Apply Lloyd-style refinement after greedy clustering |
| `--iterations` | `3` | Max refinement passes (with `--refinement`) |
| `--backend` | `auto` | `auto` \| `rust` \| `python` |
| `-q, --quiet` | — | Suppress progress output |

**Threshold guide:**

| Value | Effect |
|-------|--------|
| 0.8 | Strict — mostly exact matches + very conservative substitutions |
| 0.6 | Moderate — allows 1–2 conservative substitutions (recommended) |
| 0.4 | Relaxed — broader groups for exploratory analysis |

## How it works

1. **Anchor extraction.** Each peptide is reduced to its 6-residue anchor: the
   first `--n-front` (3) and last `--n-back` (3) amino acids. Peptides shorter
   than that are set aside in `SHORT_peptides.fasta`.
2. **Deduplicate.** Peptides are grouped by their exact anchor, so clustering
   operates on *unique* anchors weighted by frequency.
3. **Similarity metric.** Two anchors are compared position-by-position with a
   BLOSUM62 score normalized to `sim(a,b) = B(a,b) / sqrt(B(a,a)·B(b,b))`.
   Positions **P2 and PΩ carry 2× weight** (the primary MHC-I anchors); the
   score is a weighted mean in `[−…, 1]`.
4. **Blocking.** Unique anchors are bucketed by a reduced 10-letter alphabet at
   P2 and PΩ (10×10 = 100 bins), so only plausibly-similar anchors are ever
   compared. High-weight positions are checked first with early termination.
5. **Greedy clustering.** Within each block, anchors are processed
   most-frequent-first; each joins the first centroid above `threshold` or
   becomes a new centroid.
6. **Optional refinement** (`--refinement`). A Lloyd-style pass iterates:
   medoid update → cross-block reassignment → centroid merging, until stable.

The Rust backend (`pepcluster._core`) and the pure-Python reference
(`pepcluster.clustering`) implement identical logic and produce identical
cluster assignments; the test suite asserts this parity.

## Performance

| Dataset | Python | Rust |
|---------|--------|------|
| 7K peptides | <1 s | <1 s |
| 2.5M peptides | ~3 min | ~15 s |

Speed comes from anchor deduplication, coarse-alphabet blocking, and weighted
early-termination in the similarity check.

## Building from source

Requires a [Rust toolchain](https://rustup.rs) and
[maturin](https://www.maturin.rs).

```bash
# one-time
pip install maturin

# build + install into the current environment (editable-ish)
maturin develop --release

# or build a wheel
maturin build --release      # wheel lands in target/wheels/
```

The project uses maturin's mixed layout: Rust lives in `src/lib.rs`
(compiled to `pepcluster._core`), Python in `python/pepcluster/`.

Run the tests with:

```bash
pip install pytest
pytest
```

## Releasing (maintainers)

Wheels are built for Linux / macOS / Windows by
[`.github/workflows/CI.yml`](.github/workflows/CI.yml) and published to PyPI on
version tags.

1. One-time: create a [PyPI API token](https://pypi.org/help/#apitoken) and add
   it to the repo as a secret named `MATURIN_PYPI_TOKEN`
   (**Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions**).
2. Bump the version in `pyproject.toml` **and** `Cargo.toml`.
3. Tag and push:

   ```bash
   git tag v0.1.0
   git push origin v0.1.0
   ```

The `release` job then builds all wheels + an sdist and uploads them to PyPI.
